        <h2><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h2>
        <p>My full name is Sandstrom Benjamin James Morrison, my friends call me Sandy. I am Wet'suwet'en, my mother is Carrier, born in Ashcroft, and my father is Tsimshian, born over the ocean at Sunnyside Canneries outside of Prince Rupert.</p>
        <p>I have been a musician for 9 years now. My main instrument is bass but I also play drums and guitar. I first learned how to play guitar at age 14 and I have been playing music since then.</p>

        <h2>Youth Guitar Camp</h2>
        <p>When I first learned how to play guitar, I didn't take lessons. Instead I tried to learn through a beginner guitar class offered by my highschool. It wasn't that great. Instead of an actual music instructor, they just got a math teacher who happened to play guitar on the weekend. He wasn't very inspiring and I wasn't very motivated to learn. So I didn't make a lot progress in my first year of playing guitar.</p>
        <p>It wasn't until I went to the Smithers Youth Guitar Camp that my guitar playing actually made some progress.</p>
